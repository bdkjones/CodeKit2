CodeKit 2 Issues
=======================

This is the public issue tracker for CodeKit 2.


### How to Report a Bug

1. Search exisiting open AND closed issues.
2. If no issue matches what you're seeing, fill out a new one and include ALL of this information:

* Brief summary
* Expected results
* Actual results
* A link to download a zipped demo project that I can use to test your bug
* Exact steps to reproduce the bug (which file to compile, etc.)
* Your system information: which version of CodeKit, which OS, which browser you're using, etc.

(Feature requests and non-bug-report issues do not need the information above, obviously.)


### Warning

If you file a bug without all of the information above, you're going to get a response from me that says, "Read the README."


----------------------------------

### The Shift-Start Trick

If you run into problems, quit CodeKit and relaunch it while holding down the shift key. That clears out existing data and gives you a fresh start. It will not trash your preferences. If you need to delete the app's preferences file, open Terminal and type: `defaults delete com.incident57.codekit2` (Do NOT delete this file in the Finder. OS 10.9 caches plist files and running the command above flushes that cache. If you simply delete the file in the Finder, you will have to reboot your Mac before the change will take effect.)
