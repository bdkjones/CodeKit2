CodeKit 2 Beta
==============


### SECRECY

Do NOT share CodeKit 2. No tweets, no screenshots, no sending the app to your buddy, etc. You are the first people other than my close friends to see CodeKit 2. Please don't ruin my launch.


---------------------------------------------------------

### Filing Bugs

1. *BE SURE* you're running the latest beta.
2. Search the issues page (including closed issues) for the bug you're seeing.
3. If the bug is new, write up an issue and include:

+ Bug description
+ How you got it to happen (steps to reproduce)
+ What OS you're on
+ What editor you're using, what language you're working in, etc.



---------------------------------------------------------

### How To Proceed

1. Download the zipped application above.
2. Unzip.
3. Drag CodeKit 2 to your Applications folder.
4. QUIT CODEKIT 1!
5. Launch CodeKit 2.

---------------------------------------------------------

### What To Focus On

I'll update this list as we go, but for now I'd like to focus testing on:

1. Browser refresh using external servers.
2. Browser refresh in projects that use complex tools like Wordpress or Drupal.
3. Browser refresh on devices (iPhone, iPad, Android, Kindle, Nook, etc.)
4. Hooks -- do they work reliably? Are they performant?
5. Project settings syncing across teams -- does it work correctly?

---------------------------------------------------------

### The Shift-Start Trick

If you run into problems, quit CodeKit and relaunch it while holding down the shift key. That clears out existing data and gives you a fresh start. It will not trash your preferences. If you need to delete the app's preferences file, open Terminal and type: `defaults delete com.incident57.codekit2` (Do NOT delete this file in the Finder. OS 10.9 caches plist files and running the command above flushes that cache. If you simply delete the file in the Finder, you will have to reboot your Mac before the change will take effect.)
