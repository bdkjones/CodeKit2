CodeKit 2 Issue Tracker
=======================

This is the public issue tracker for CodeKit 2.


### How to Not Suck At Bug Reporting

1. Before opening an issue, search exisiting open AND closed issues. 
2. For bug reports, include a demo file/project (or link to download one) that SHOWS THE ISSUE so I can debug with it.
3. INCLUDE DETAILS. Build of CodeKit, version of OS X. Which browser you use, which language you're writing, etc. Everything is helpful. 


----------------------------------

### The Shift-Start Trick

If you run into problems, quit CodeKit and relaunch it while holding down the shift key. That clears out existing data and gives you a fresh start. It will not trash your preferences. If you need to delete the app's preferences file, open Terminal and type: `defaults delete com.incident57.codekit2` (Do NOT delete this file in the Finder. OS 10.9 caches plist files and running the command above flushes that cache. If you simply delete the file in the Finder, you will have to reboot your Mac before the change will take effect.)
