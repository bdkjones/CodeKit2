Beta 19 (16653)
--------------------------------------------

-- License activation tracking now in place in preparation for launch

-- CodeKit's internal server now correctly returns a 404 status code for missing files. Previously, a 200 was returned.

-- Strings next to checkboxes in the preferences window are no longer truncated

-- If a text field is selected, when you click outside of it (on blank space in the window), it will now de-select itself.

-- If a Hook's source code changes outside of the app, you now receive a warning and the Hook is automatically disabled until you check the code, make sure it's safe and re-enable it. Those of you who have been using Hooks will see this on the first run of this build. This stops your evil co-worker from creating a Hook that does "rm ~/Documents -rf", pushing that project, having you pull it and then save a file and watching your Documents folder evaporate. Good addition, no?

-- Since the above is now in place, Hooks are now loaded from the project settings file.

-- A Hook with no souce-code set will no longer cause the message bar at the bottom of the app to get stuck on the "running hooks" message. (Hi Aaron!)

-- Optimized images now correctly retain their checkmark icons

-- Even more optimizations to the file-event handling algorithm; should be a few fractions of a second faster now.

-- When you change project settings and CodeKit saves them to the config.codekit file, that file-change event will no longer trigger a completely pointless refresh in the app. If the config.codekit file changes externally, the app will refresh to capture the new file's settings.

-- Clicking any part of the "External Server Required" switch will now toggle the switch. I write detailed change logs.

-- "Set Output Path" and "Compile" contextual menu options now correctly disabled for files in a CodeKit Framework

-- Ruby Sass updated to 3.3.rc5. Fixes huge bug that broke Zurb Foundation.









Beta 18 (16609)
--------------------------------------------

-- Menubar icon now yellow for warnings and red for errors. 

-- New option to have latest log entries appear at the top instead of the bottom

-- Fix typo in Bower warning dialog

-- The Languages section of Project Settings: "apply" text added to buttons so it's more obvious what they do

-- Fix issue where wrong checkbox state was shown in the Projects Popover when the tableview in that popover loses firstResponder status

-- Fix issue that stopped Stylus files from compiling when using Nib

-- The Ruby Sass compiler has been rolled back to an earlier version between 3.3.rc2 and 3.3.rc3 because the Sass team introduced some bugs that cripple Foundation in the latest updates. I've got them working on the problem.







Beta 17 (16546)
-------------------------------------------

-- FIXED: Hooks code editor is now horizontally scrollable

-- CHANGED: If you rename a file that generates an output file, the output file will now be renamed accordingly (by applying your default output path settings) UNLESS you have specifically set an output path for the file in question by clicking the "target" button and choosing a path yourself. This solves the issue where you duplicate a file in your IDE (say, "main copy.sass") and then rename that file to "other.sass". Previously, it would still compile to "main copy.css". Now it will compile to "other.css". 

-- Installing Zurb Foundation through the "New Foundation Project" workflow will now remove the '.git' and '.gitignore' files from the project folder

-- Added several items to the default Skipped Items list to make the app just work with Statamic projects

-- Sass updated to 3.3.0.rc3 (Brings several fixes, including limiting deprecation warnings when variables don't use !global syntax)







Beta 16 (16534)
------------------------------------------

-- Copyright year updated

-- Warning about libsass being experimental no longer shown when turning libsass OFF.

-- Fixed: bug in Sass compiler that could cause hangs if Sass spits out more than 64kb of text to the standard error pipe while running. (Also got the Sass team to fix this on their end, so Sass no longer spits out Tolstoy-length errors)

-- Fixed: bug that added an extra CRLF sequence between the headers and body of an HTTP response that contains a Set-Cookie header, resulting in truncated content in the browser

-- JSHint updated to 2.4.3. Brings several new options

-- JSLint updated to the 2014-01-26 release. Adds the 'todo' option

-- Bourbon & Bourbon Neat both updated to latest releases. Note: they are still not fully compatible with Sass 3.3; you'll get deprecation warnings when compiling

-- "Lost connection" bar z-index now actually higher, like it was supposed to be in the last beta

-- Stylus updated to 0.42.2

-- Nib updated to 1.0.2

-- CoffeeScript updated to 1.7.1

-- Jade updated to 1.1.5

-- The URL for the "Check For Updates" feature has been changed from the CodeKit 1.x URL in preparation for launch







Beta 15 (16495)
------------------------------------------

-- Changes were made to the app's data model, so this release will wipe everything on first launch. (No data migration in betas -- I save that work for production releases.)

-- All entries in the project config file are now alphabetized. Makes working with them in Git more pleasant. 

-- Fixed bug where no projects appeared in sidebar when app launches if all projects were disabled. 

-- Fixed bug where the preview icon of the CodeKit window in Mission Control's Spaces view always showed the drag overlay instead of the current window state.

-- All domain values for Set-Cookie headers are now stripped before a response from an external server is forwarded to the browser by CodeKit. With no explicit domain defined for the Cookie, the browser will store and send that cookie for the current document's domain, which is exactly what we want. (Resolves Drupal login issue and similar.)

-- When installing Compass and Foundation in empty projects (or projects that have only a codekit.config file), you'll no longer be prompted to confirm deleting all project contents. Resolves irritating UX confirmations for New Compass Project and New Foundation Project workflows.

-- Fixes issue where output files may not show up in CodeKit window until after a project refresh. They now show up as soon as they're created (by triggering a project refresh on creation). 

-- TypeScript compiler fully implemented.

-- TypeScript updated to version 0.9.5

-- UglifyJS updated to 2.4.12

-- Node.js updated to 0.10.25

-- For CoffeeScript, Javascript and TypeScript: dragging a prepended/appended file out of the list in the inspector will now show the system-standard "delete" cloud correctly. The snap-back animation is also fixed: the import link will now delete immediately when you release the drag. But as a byproduct, it's no longer possible to drag these items outside of CodeKit to open them in an editor, etc. (None of this applies to import links created with in-file statements.)

-- Fixed animation glitch: The inspector will now wait until the "spinner bar" at the bottom of the app finishes animating in/out before it animates in. Previously, it would animate in simultaneously, producing a grey area at the top as the frame changed size during animation.

-- AutoPrefixer updated to 1.0.20140203

-- Using Autoprefixer should no longer break source maps (the maps will be updated with the changes made by Autoprefixer). In theory.

-- Less updated to 1.6.2

-- Libsass updated to the latest commit; will still probably fail in a lot of cases. It's alpha, people!

-- Added a warning dialog box when you enable Libsass.

-- When using Ruby Sass, if a file compiles successfully but generates warnings (such as deprecation notices), those will now be shown in the log.

-- New preferences to control whether the app comes to the front and beeps when compiling succeeds but includes warnings.








Beta 14 (16377)
------------------------------------------

-- Bourbon updated to the latest version. Fixes an issue where compiling a stylesheet with Bourbon would hang indefinitely.

-- THE CHROME COOKIE ISSUE IS FIXED. Took 2+ weeks, hours of trial-and-error and, eventually, rewriting part of OS X. But you can now log into Wordpress on Chrome.

-- Keyboard shortcut added for "Preview". Hit command+p.

-- Tooltips fixed in Project Settings area

-- It is no longer possible to launch more than one "Choose Output Path" panel at a time

-- The black pixel in the 32x32 app icon is fixed

-- Reverted trailing slash logic to fix issues with redirect loops. If you see delays when previewing projects using an external server, let me know and try adding a trailing slash.









Beta 13 (16338)
------------------------------------------

-- External Server overhaul. Port textfield eliminated, ability to specify a subpath to load when clicking preview button added. Supports Symphony2 server configurations, with docRoot above the project folder. (You now add the port into the address field, if needed.)

-- External server option now uses a giant switch instead of the small checkbox

-- Assets tab: sorting by name is no longer case-sensitive.

-- CKRP.js "reset to root" reloads now account for the new "preview path addition" above.

-- Various spelling errors fixed

-- Clicking the "lost connection" overlay will now reload the page (good for when your iOS device goes to sleep).

-- IP-based external server address now prefers IPs starting with 192, 171 or 10 over all others.

-- Remove icon on projects popover tableViewCells now hovers correctly if you remove a row and the next row's icon slides under the cursor

-- Clicking the project refresh button while editing a textField in project settings will now commit the textField's current value to the project settings file before refreshing. (Before, the editing value was discarded and reset to whatever was in the project config file.)

-- When using an External server and viewing a URL that has a query string, now correctly adds the injection script into the HEAD element if it exists. Previously, the query string would cause detection of an HTML file to fail. Now use "content-type" header value rather than file extension to determine if the returned resource is HTML.

-- If you move an output file (one that's created when another file is processed) out of your project, the creator file's outputPath setting will remain the same. If you move the file WITHIN the project, the creator file's outputPath setting will update to compile the file to its new location. Previously, the outputPath always changed, leading to bad behavior when files were moved out of the project folder.

-- No dice on the Chrome cookie issue yet. Still working. For now, use Safari if you need to log in to Wordpress, etc.








BETA 12 (16142)
------------------------------------------

-- Fixes a bug introduced in Beta 11 where External Server Addresses with subpaths or without trailing slashes were handled incorrectly leading to addresses such as: http://localhost:8888(null)/

-- I should not be allowed to write software.







BETA 11 (16140)
------------------------------------------

-- External Server addresses that contain a trailing slash are now handled correctly.

-- "Update all Installed Components" in the Assets area is now functional.

-- Fixed: In Kit files, @import statements that contain a filepath NOT wrapped in quotes are now handled correctly. Previously, those files would not be detected.

-- Has ANYONE tested ANY hooks, whatsoever? So many people asked for this feature and I spent a lot of time on it!

-- I think we're actually getting close...







BETA 10 (16108)
------------------------------------------

Still procrastinating on server stuff. That's for tomorrow. In the meantime, this Beta fixes a few lingering issues:

-- Autoprefixer now runs correctly after compiling with libsass

-- Compass should now run correctly in every case

-- If you create a JS or CoffeeScript import link by dragging/dropping within CodeKit, you can now delete that link by selecting it in the right-hand inspector area and pressing delete

-- CodeKit's internal servers now wait 2.5 seconds before responding to OS X's "network status has changed" events so they're less likely to grab the wrong IP address for your Mac. (Your IP does not instantly get assigned the minute you wake your Mac up; it takes some time for that to resolve.)

-- Removed some extraneous logging







BETA 9 (16100)
------------------------------------------

-- I got tired of working on server stuff, so I decided to fix some other bugs. Also, my designer informed me that I broke Compass in the previous beta and he couldn't work on my website until I fixed the app. Hence:

-- Compass now works correctly.

-- Installing Zurb (or creating a new Zurb project) now works again.

-- You no longer need Git installed on your system to use the "Assets" area or to create a new Zurb project

-- Less has been updated to version 1.6

-- NOTE: if you choose the "compressed" output option for your Less files, you will not get a sourcemap. This is a known shortcoming of Less 1.6. Nothing I can do about it until the Less team gets it working.







BETA 8 (16052)
------------------------------------------

A.K.A. "No, really. The server stuff is fixed now."

-- IMPORTANT: CodeKit now requires OS 10.8+. I use some APIs that aren't available on 10.7.

-- Big change: CodeKit no longer automatically contacts your external server if it can't handle a resource on its own. Your project either uses an external server, or it does not and you control that in the settings. This provides more predictable behavior.

-- All projects using external servers should now "just work". Cookies, Redirects, .htaccess, MOD_REWRITE, subpaths in your server address (e.g. http://localhost:8888/some/path/to/webroot)... all of it should be bulletproof now. Thanks to all those who provided sample projects! I used them extensively to test and made sure each one worked correctly.

-- Wordpress sites now work correctly, including the back-end administration area.

-- Fixed: issue where changes to JSHint and JSLint settings were not saved after refreshing a project

-- Fixed: Git is now bundled correctly into the application package, so Bower works even if you don't have Git installed on your Mac.

-- Updated error pages for 404, external server errors, no index page errors, etc.







BETA 7 (15888)
------------------------------------------

A.K.A. "The Build that finally fixes all the server stuff."

-- Using an external server should be roughly twice as fast in this build. CodeKit is now much more efficient at forwarding HTTP requests to the external server. In practical terms, you should feel almost no speed difference between using CodeKit's proxy server and going to your external server's address directly.

-- The "Content-Length" HTTP response header is now updated correctly when CodeKit injects text into a page. This eliminates issues where parts of pages do not load.

-- Using an external server address with a subpath now works correctly. Example: You have MAMP set to host a folder called "sites". MAMP is running on port 8888 at localhost. The "sites" folder contains a bunch of subfolders, each one of which is a website project. One of these subfolders is called "clientX". You add "clientX" to CodeKit as a project, then enter this for your external server address (in project settings): "http://localhost/clientX" Hit preview and it just works.

-- If you enter a port in the "external server address" text field by adding a colon after the host name (example: http://localhost:4321/somePath), the '4321' is now discarded and replaced by the value of the "port" textfield in the project settings.

-- ALL caching is now disabled for both internal and external servers. CodeKit strips the "If-Modified-Since" and "If-None-Match" HTTP headers from incoming requests so that you are GUARANTEED to have every resource re-served from the server, whether that's the internal one or external one. This is what you want when you're developing; caches are trouble.

-- Fixed a couple edge-case crash scenarios

-- Fixed an issue related to the libsass update in Beta 6





BETA 6 (15860)
------------------------------------------

- Resolves crashes when clicking the "Preview" button

- I could write all the technical details about what's changed in the browser refreshing process, but it's super complex. Here's the bottom line:

1) Wordpress should just work. All of it. 
2) If you use MOD_REWRITE or permalinks or .htaccess files, you need to check the "Use External Server for all requests" box. 
3) You should check that box for Wordpress projects.

- The change in Beta 5 that had CodeKit automatically contact the external server when a given resource does not exist locally is REVERSED. (There were unintended consequences.) This is why you must check the "use external server for all requests" box when your site uses MOD_REWRITE --- the URLs you request do not map to files on disk; those URLs must be transformed by the MOD_REWRITE rules to map to files that should be served. That process is handled by your external server.

- The hidden .sass-cache folder will now be created in the correct location: the same folder as your Sass file.

- Skipped items can now include paths relative to the project folder. (Allows you to skip one specific folder named "vendor" but not another folder named "vendor" at a different path, etc.)

- Fixes issue where Sass output paths were not applied when you change them in project settings and then click the "sync" button.

- Other bug fixes I was too lazy to put in my Git commit messages.




BETA 5 (15825)
------------------------------------------

- libsass should no longer crash

- Source maps now available with libsass. However, there is a killer bug in libsass that currently writes the wrong output filename in the source map file. You'll need to change "file.scss" to "file.css" manually each time the map is written. There's an open issue on the libsass page to fix this.

- If a file does not exist AND is a type that CodeKit can serve itself (HTML, JS, CSS, etc), CodeKit will now automatically toss the request to your external server RATHER than simply returning a 404. This should resolve issues with custom MOD_REWRITE and permalinks in Wordpress. 

- Autoprefixer updated to 1.0. Minified CSS will now remain minified after autoprefixer runs.

- Fixed: crash when a project is removed while the 'scope' is set to something other than "All Files"

- Fixed: screenshot window size is now always correct

- Fixed: Files will no longer double-compile. NOTE: From now on, CodeKit will acknowledge a file-save event only once every 1.5 seconds. If you save a file more often than once every 1.5 seconds, every save event will be ignored until 1.5 seconds have elapsed since the last save event that CodeKit responded to.

- Fixed (hopefully): Glitches when the Inspector pane animates in on 10.8.5. 




BETA 4  (15773)
------------------------------------------

- Tons of changes. Read carefully:

- CodeKit's internal server now defaults to non-Bonjour addresses based on the IP assigned by your local area network, if one is available. (These addresses look like this: http://192.168.1.17:5757) These addresses work on devices that don't support Bonjour (Android). IP-based addresses are only available if you're connected to a network. If you aren't, CodeKit will fall back to the Bonjour-based address (like http://vdk.local:5757). When your Mac next connects to a network, CodeKit will automatically switch back to IP-based addresses. When you disconnect from a network, it will automatically switch to Bonjour-based addresses. The idea is: it should always just work.

- The "Preview" button will still open the Bonjour-based address. The Server popover shows the non-Bonjour address you'll need to use on Android. 

- You can now customize the Bower_Components folder location. See General pane of project settings area.

- Internal server now returns correct content-type headers for JS and CSS files. Eliminates pedantic errors in Chrome console.

- Preferenes window now comes to front when selected from menubar command while app is in background

- Cached versions of files should NEVER be served now. Theoretically.

- New options for browser refreshing: disable animation, turn on reload of file:// URLS. (Leaving the latter off will improve performance.)

- Option to specify a webroot that is different than the project's root folder. The webroot is the folder that will open when you click the 'Preview' button.

- All the bugs with output-path-setting should be fixed. NOTE: you still have to click the "sync" button in the upper right to apply new output paths; they do not automatically apply to existing files in a project when you edit them in the project settings area.

- Various UI changes

- The release notes will be funny again when we leave beta. 







BETA 3
------------------------------------------

- Fixed tooltips on Less source map checkboxes in Inspector and project settings areas

- Added alert when re-writing MAMP's configuration makes no changes to files.

- Added "Tools" menu containing option to re-run MAMP OPCache disabling.

- Tried implementing source maps for libsass, but something isn't right. Working with libsass team to get it fixed.

- Crash window graphics updated and retina-fied

- SVG images now supported by CodeKit's internal server

- POST requests now supported by CodeKit's internal server for url-encoded type. multipart/form-data type unsupported.

- Browser refreshing in Firefox is fixed

- UI glitches fixed in project settings area when you have OS X set to "always display" scrollbars.






BETA 2
------------------------------------------

- Eliminate the 'none' output style for JS files

- JS files will always syntax check when saved (if you have set them to do so), regardless of whether they create an output file or not

- Hide the splash screen anytime the drawer area opens. Fixes several UI glitches.

- Checkboxes in the CodeKit Frameworks list in Project Settings now work correctly

- Fixed an issue that caused the app to crash anytime you added a projet if you had first modified any "New Project Defaults" options for JSHint or JSLint.

- Added better handling to avoid crashes when stuff goes wrong with watched folder paths






BETA 1
------------------------------------------

Initial release
