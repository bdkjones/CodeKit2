BETA 7 (15888)
------------------------------------------

A.K.A. "The Build that finally fixes all the server stuff."

-- Using an external server should be roughly twice as fast in this build. CodeKit is now much more efficient at forwarding HTTP requests to the external server. In practical terms, you should feel almost no speed difference between using CodeKit's proxy server and going to your external server's address directly.

-- The "Content-Length" HTTP response header is now updated correctly when CodeKit injects text into a page. This eliminates issues where parts of pages do not load.

-- Using an external server address with a subpath now works correctly. Example: You have MAMP set to host a folder called "sites". MAMP is running on port 8888 at localhost. The "sites" folder contains a bunch of subfolders, each one of which is a website project. One of these subfolders is called "clientX". You add "clientX" to CodeKit as a project, then enter this for your external server address (in project settings): "http://localhost/clientX" Hit preview and it just works.

-- If you enter a port in the "external server address" text field by adding a colon after the host name (example: http://localhost:4321/somePath), the '4321' is now discarded and replaced by the value of the "port" textfield in the project settings.

-- ALL caching is now disabled for both internal and external servers. CodeKit strips the "If-Modified-Since" and "If-None-Match" HTTP headers from incoming requests so that you are GUARANTEED to have every resource re-served from the server, whether that's the internal one or external one. This is what you want when you're developing; caches are trouble.

-- Fixed a couple edge-case crash scenarios

-- Fixed an issue related to the libsass update in Beta 6





BETA 6 (15860)
------------------------------------------

- Resolves crashes when clicking the "Preview" button

- I could write all the technical details about what's changed in the browser refreshing process, but it's super complex. Here's the bottom line:

1) Wordpress should just work. All of it. 
2) If you use MOD_REWRITE or permalinks or .htaccess files, you need to check the "Use External Server for all requests" box. 
3) You should check that box for Wordpress projects.

- The change in Beta 5 that had CodeKit automatically contact the external server when a given resource does not exist locally is REVERSED. (There were unintended consequences.) This is why you must check the "use external server for all requests" box when your site uses MOD_REWRITE --- the URLs you request do not map to files on disk; those URLs must be transformed by the MOD_REWRITE rules to map to files that should be served. That process is handled by your external server.

- The hidden .sass-cache folder will now be created in the correct location: the same folder as your Sass file.

- Skipped items can now include paths relative to the project folder. (Allows you to skip one specific folder named "vendor" but not another folder named "vendor" at a different path, etc.)

- Fixes issue where Sass output paths were not applied when you change them in project settings and then click the "sync" button.

- Other bug fixes I was too lazy to put in my Git commit messages.




BETA 5 (15825)
------------------------------------------

- libsass should no longer crash

- Source maps now available with libsass. However, there is a killer bug in libsass that currently writes the wrong output filename in the source map file. You'll need to change "file.scss" to "file.css" manually each time the map is written. There's an open issue on the libsass page to fix this.

- If a file does not exist AND is a type that CodeKit can serve itself (HTML, JS, CSS, etc), CodeKit will now automatically toss the request to your external server RATHER than simply returning a 404. This should resolve issues with custom MOD_REWRITE and permalinks in Wordpress. 

- Autoprefixer updated to 1.0. Minified CSS will now remain minified after autoprefixer runs.

- Fixed: crash when a project is removed while the 'scope' is set to something other than "All Files"

- Fixed: screenshot window size is now always correct

- Fixed: Files will no longer double-compile. NOTE: From now on, CodeKit will acknowledge a file-save event only once every 1.5 seconds. If you save a file more often than once every 1.5 seconds, every save event will be ignored until 1.5 seconds have elapsed since the last save event that CodeKit responded to.

- Fixed (hopefully): Glitches when the Inspector pane animates in on 10.8.5. 




BETA 4  (15773)
------------------------------------------

- Tons of changes. Read carefully:

- CodeKit's internal server now defaults to non-Bonjour addresses based on the IP assigned by your local area network, if one is available. (These addresses look like this: http://192.168.1.17:5757) These addresses work on devices that don't support Bonjour (Android). IP-based addresses are only available if you're connected to a network. If you aren't, CodeKit will fall back to the Bonjour-based address (like http://vdk.local:5757). When your Mac next connects to a network, CodeKit will automatically switch back to IP-based addresses. When you disconnect from a network, it will automatically switch to Bonjour-based addresses. The idea is: it should always just work.

- The "Preview" button will still open the Bonjour-based address. The Server popover shows the non-Bonjour address you'll need to use on Android. 

- You can now customize the Bower_Components folder location. See General pane of project settings area.

- Internal server now returns correct content-type headers for JS and CSS files. Eliminates pedantic errors in Chrome console.

- Preferenes window now comes to front when selected from menubar command while app is in background

- Cached versions of files should NEVER be served now. Theoretically.

- New options for browser refreshing: disable animation, turn on reload of file:// URLS. (Leaving the latter off will improve performance.)

- Option to specify a webroot that is different than the project's root folder. The webroot is the folder that will open when you click the 'Preview' button.

- All the bugs with output-path-setting should be fixed. NOTE: you still have to click the "sync" button in the upper right to apply new output paths; they do not automatically apply to existing files in a project when you edit them in the project settings area.

- Various UI changes

- The release notes will be funny again when we leave beta. 







BETA 3
------------------------------------------

- Fixed tooltips on Less source map checkboxes in Inspector and project settings areas

- Added alert when re-writing MAMP's configuration makes no changes to files.

- Added "Tools" menu containing option to re-run MAMP OPCache disabling.

- Tried implementing source maps for libsass, but something isn't right. Working with libsass team to get it fixed.

- Crash window graphics updated and retina-fied

- SVG images now supported by CodeKit's internal server

- POST requests now supported by CodeKit's internal server for url-encoded type. multipart/form-data type unsupported.

- Browser refreshing in Firefox is fixed

- UI glitches fixed in project settings area when you have OS X set to "always display" scrollbars.






BETA 2
------------------------------------------

- Eliminate the 'none' output style for JS files

- JS files will always syntax check when saved (if you have set them to do so), regardless of whether they create an output file or not

- Hide the splash screen anytime the drawer area opens. Fixes several UI glitches.

- Checkboxes in the CodeKit Frameworks list in Project Settings now work correctly

- Fixed an issue that caused the app to crash anytime you added a projet if you had first modified any "New Project Defaults" options for JSHint or JSLint.

- Added better handling to avoid crashes when stuff goes wrong with watched folder paths
