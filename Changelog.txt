BETA 5 (15825)
------------------------------------------

- libsass should no longer crash

- Source maps now available with libsass. However, there is a killer bug in libsass that currently writes the wrong output filename in the source map file. You'll need to change "file.scss" to "file.css" manually each time the map is written. There's an open issue on the libsass page to fix this.

- If a file does not exist AND is a type that CodeKit can serve itself (HTML, JS, CSS, etc), CodeKit will now automatically toss the request to your external server RATHER than simply returning a 404. This should resolve issues with custom MOD_REWRITE and permalinks in Wordpress. 

- Autoprefixer updated to 1.0. Minified CSS will now remain minified after autoprefixer runs.

- Fixed: crash when a project is removed while the 'scope' is set to something other than "All Files"

- Fixed: screenshot window size is now always correct

- Fixed: Files will no longer double-compile. NOTE: From now on, CodeKit will acknowledge a file-save event only once every 1.5 seconds. If you save a file more often than once every 1.5 seconds, every save event will be ignored until 1.5 seconds have elapsed since the last save event that CodeKit responded to.

- Fixed (hopefully): Glitches when the Inspector pane animates in on 10.8.5. 




BETA 4  (15773)
------------------------------------------

- Tons of changes. Read carefully:

- CodeKit's internal server now defaults to non-Bonjour addresses based on the IP assigned by your local area network, if one is available. (These addresses look like this: http://192.168.1.17:5757) These addresses work on devices that don't support Bonjour (Android). IP-based addresses are only available if you're connected to a network. If you aren't, CodeKit will fall back to the Bonjour-based address (like http://vdk.local:5757). When your Mac next connects to a network, CodeKit will automatically switch back to IP-based addresses. When you disconnect from a network, it will automatically switch to Bonjour-based addresses. The idea is: it should always just work.

- The "Preview" button will still open the Bonjour-based address. The Server popover shows the non-Bonjour address you'll need to use on Android. 

- You can now customize the Bower_Components folder location. See General pane of project settings area.

- Internal server now returns correct content-type headers for JS and CSS files. Eliminates pedantic errors in Chrome console.

- Preferenes window now comes to front when selected from menubar command while app is in background

- Cached versions of files should NEVER be served now. Theoretically.

- New options for browser refreshing: disable animation, turn on reload of file:// URLS. (Leaving the latter off will improve performance.)

- Option to specify a webroot that is different than the project's root folder. The webroot is the folder that will open when you click the 'Preview' button.

- All the bugs with output-path-setting should be fixed. NOTE: you still have to click the "sync" button in the upper right to apply new output paths; they do not automatically apply to existing files in a project when you edit them in the project settings area.

- Various UI changes

- The release notes will be funny again when we leave beta. 







BETA 3
------------------------------------------

- Fixed tooltips on Less source map checkboxes in Inspector and project settings areas

- Added alert when re-writing MAMP's configuration makes no changes to files.

- Added "Tools" menu containing option to re-run MAMP OPCache disabling.

- Tried implementing source maps for libsass, but something isn't right. Working with libsass team to get it fixed.

- Crash window graphics updated and retina-fied

- SVG images now supported by CodeKit's internal server

- POST requests now supported by CodeKit's internal server for url-encoded type. multipart/form-data type unsupported.

- Browser refreshing in Firefox is fixed

- UI glitches fixed in project settings area when you have OS X set to "always display" scrollbars.






BETA 2
------------------------------------------

- Eliminate the 'none' output style for JS files

- JS files will always syntax check when saved (if you have set them to do so), regardless of whether they create an output file or not

- Hide the splash screen anytime the drawer area opens. Fixes several UI glitches.

- Checkboxes in the CodeKit Frameworks list in Project Settings now work correctly

- Fixed an issue that caused the app to crash anytime you added a projet if you had first modified any "New Project Defaults" options for JSHint or JSLint.

- Added better handling to avoid crashes when stuff goes wrong with watched folder paths
